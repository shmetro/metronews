On its outlook for raising rates, the Minutes indicate that a number of FOMC members saw the risks as weighted towards raising rates too early, with at least one FOMC member recommending more not less monetary policy accommodation.  
Following this release, the stock market was climbing off its lowest levels of the day, though the Dow and S&P 500 were still in negative territory.

The Minutes indicate that in its meeting, the Fed said of the economic situation, "The information reviewed for the January 27-28 meeting indicated that economic activity expanded at a solid pace over the second half of 2014, and that labor market conditions had again improved in recent months."  
**On the financial situation, the Fed said:**  
Over the intermeeting period, amid trading that was volatile at times, longer-term sovereign yields in the United States and other advanced economies declined. These moves were attributed in part to a deterioration in market sentiment associated with downward pressure on inflation, increased concern about the global economic outlook, and announced and anticipated foreign central bank policies.

Moreover, continued sharp declines in oil prices and U.S. economic data releases that were viewed by investors as a bit weaker than anticipated, on balance, reportedly weighed on sentiment.  
Regarding Greece, the Fed said only that "financial uncertainty" in Greece, as well as geopolitical instability in the Middle East and Ukraine, remained as risks to the international outlook.  
The Fed is also unsure about how to communicate with the market regarding the first interest rate hike since 2006, with the Minutes indicating that, "A number of participants noted that while forward guidance had been a very useful tool under the extraordinary conditions of recent years, as the start of normalization approaches, there would be limits to the specificity that the Committee could provide about its timing."

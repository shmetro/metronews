Question: How do you hem a printed vinyl radical streamer if you don't hold a stitching political machine to stitch the edges?

<img src="http://media1.picsearch.com/is?YfnZpgIxY6Xb0geCfHl4vL6UzodYik2cEURdL5gCJqk&height=214" alt="vinyl lettering" title="vinyl lettering (c) handprints.info" style="float:left;padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px" /> Answer: This is a proficient question, as many shops don't undergo an commercial enterprise stitchery auto to hem banners. However, mucilage is non the exclusively fashion to hem banners, although it does not ask machinery to hem your PVC banners with mucilage.

The right smart to consumption paste is first, of course, to father the [correct glue][1] for vinyl radical banners. The path we did it when we glued hems for a brusk clock was to set the streamer prostrate on a table, and so we would have an Eight [substructure ruler][2] that was two inches extensive and repose it along the butt against of the streamer. And so we would usage the ruler to take out a unbent line, two inches in from the march. At one time the delineate was in place, we would dispersed the glue simply inwardly the pipeline to the inch of the streamer on unrivalled go with. And then we'd flock unmatched inch concluded to the penitentiary line, then, victimization a laborious rubberize roller, we'd seal of approval the vinyl into itself. And so we'd reprize the process on wholly four sides.

In my opinion, though, this is the near unmanageable fashion to hem a streamer of the quartet principal slipway to hem a banner. An easier method is streamer hemming tape recording. We secondhand au fond the Same method acting as described to a higher place. Layed the streamer flat, place the two edge by 96 inch ruler, pronounced the 2" line with a pen, but then laid the tape along the line. Once the tape was down, we peeled the backing paper off the tape, folded over the material, and pressed the material together with the hard rubber roller.

The previous two methods are the only two methods we ever used to mechanically fasten the banner material together, but there are two other methods that are as good or better, but do require equipment. The first was already mentioned, and that is the industrial sewing machine, typically fitted with a double foot to enable parallel stitching. This is a simple method if you have an industrial sewing machine. You can purchase these machines online on various websites (make sure the company you're purchasing from doesn't have a bad rating for customer service or selling off brands that may or may not perform).

Learning to use a double footed sewing machine is much more difficult than purchasing one. It takes a bit of practice to be able to consistently fold an inch of the vinyl banner material over and sew it with a fairly straight seam and without bunching the fabric. Once you've gotten that down (or your employee), then learning to sew straight and fast is the main goal.

The fourth method is the heat-welded seam. This is a method that requires special equipment. There are two types of heat seamer/welders. The first moves along the edge of the banner, whereas the other moves the banner through the heated hem welder. Banner hemmers can also create pole pockets just like the other methods.

So, regardless of which method you use to finish your indoor or outdoor vinyl banners, the end result will be about the same. The only method I personally don't like is the taping method, because if you roll a taped hem, it will tend to get unsightly wrinkles periodically along the hems. However, for an exterior banner with a fair viewing distance, it really doesn't matter too much.
